# modular-exponentiation
Implementation of Modular Exponentiation Algorithm.

## What Is
In computing arithmetic expressions mod m, taking intermediate results mod m before the final result is obtained  
is sometimes convenient.  Large numbers can cause an overflow.

Theorem:  
Let 洧녴 be an integer larger than 1.  Let 洧논 and 洧녽 be any integers.  Then:  
[(洧논 mod 洧녴) + (洧녽 mod 洧녴)] mod 洧녴 = [洧논 + 洧녽] mod 洧녴  
[(洧논 mod 洧녴)(洧녽 mod 洧녴)] mod 洧녴 = [洧논 * 洧녽] mod 洧녴
